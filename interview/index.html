  <p id="context"> Ishneet Ahluwalia is a Fshion Designer based in Bombay, India. Down below is a multiple choice questionnaire about the role of graphic design in her career. She belives that design is very subjective for everyone. There is no particular order that she design in. Sometimes, an idea clicks for a print and sometimes for a style, it goes both ways. Sometimes a particular silhouette is thought of, and feels that print would work in placement vs all over so she designs the print accordingly. Sometimes when she designs a print and feels the print speaks for itself then she designs the silhouette in a simple manner so that they both blend well together. However when she is designing a collection or a capsule collection, she does make mood boards and so on and so forth and work simultaneously to make them blend together.  </p>
  <p>In India there is a lot of labor at our disposal, so what Ishneet feels helped her the most is learning stiching. During her undergrad, she learned from draping to drafting to embroidering to tailoring an outfit, she is absolutely self sufficient in terms of crafting a garment from scratch, this is something she has really benefited from fashion school.</p>
  <p>In terms of Graphics,  they are very important in the world of fashion. Not only is graphic useful for creating designs but also with everything becoming digital we need social media and graphics help us make things a lot more aesthetic, graphics also help us with mood boards and other essential stuff in the world of fashion. Print making etc wouldn’t be possible without using graphic.</p>
